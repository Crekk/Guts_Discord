Guts: She's holed up in the Fire Castle, guarded by the creeper police... Those bastards explode on sight. We're gonna need a damn good plan.

Berserk 2
the official lore document

The world of Berserk 2 follows Guts Berserk 2, alongside his trusted companions Heracross, Hornet and pet rhino, Rhinor, on a quest to defeat Dranoel Trans, also known as Captain Hot, and her gamers, to save Peakland from her evil regime(isnt this literally not true, isnt the world ruled by politics??) (i don’t remember but i think what it was was that the world is ruled by the politics but peakland by captain hot, which is the uk in real world geography). Together they are known as “The Society Livers” (社会の肝臓 - Shakai no kanzō)








Main Characters
Guts Berserk 2
"We were rejected by society, but we still have to live in it..."

The protagonist of Berserk 2, follows an alternate story from Berserk 1. When fighting the Tower of Rebirth Jailer, Guts lost to his ice magic, and remained frozen for an unknown, very long time. He gets fished up by Heracross, and wakes up in an unknown land of Peakland. Guts’ hand was not frozen, and so he lost it after getting unfrozen. He swears to take revenge on the Tower of Rebirth Jailer.
Guts has a “shadow” known as Stug. After accepting his shadow, he tames his Berserk 2 form which he can then control.
Guts also has a younger brother, Goro Akechi. 






Heracross
“Heracross” 

Before he met Guts, Heracross lived peacefully in Peakland with Pinsir, spending his days fishing. After he met Guts, he helped him out and eventually they ended up teaming together. He can only communicate by saying “Heracross”, but Guts understands him perfectly nonetheless. He and Pinsir are a gay couple. Heracross is bisexual.
Heracross had abusive black parents who found him as an egg, which leads to him being very racist. He says very offensive racial slurs very often, and learned the n-word from his parents. His reasoning is “if black people can say it, why can’t I?”. Guts in response would say “whoa man you can’t say that”. 
Heracross’ moveset is Guts (ability), Close Combat, Megahorn, Rock Blast, Sleep Talk (secret).
Hornet
Hornet Trans is Captain Hot’s younger sister, and the older sister of Kasumi Trans. She abandoned Dranoel after a disagreement about the lower class. She disagrees with her sister’s violet ways. She left Dranoel’s Fire Capitol alongside a pet rhino Rhinor, and met Guts and Heracross while fighting Captain Hot in a port town she burnt down, while they were getting there on a ship. 
Hornet is the smartest and swiftest of the Society Livers, however she is very tiny as she is a bug.


Rhinor
"I've been wondering... When did you all start scheming to turn me into Chaos Rhinor?"

Rhinor is the mount of the Society Livers. He was brought along by Hornet when she left the Fire Capitol, and now serves as the loyal steed to the Livers. They travel Peakland in a carriage pulled by Rhinor. 
Later in the story, Rhinor becomes Chaos  Rhinor. After the Society Livers meet Car from Rocket League, he feels very undervalued. (needs expansion)



Dranoel Trans / Captain Hot
“Let's put you on fire.”

Dranoel Trans, better known as Captain Hot, is the current “leader” of Peakland. Sworn to starting all crime, the Politics hunted down and brutally executed every member of the Gamers, including Captain’s hot sister. Using her skills as a gamer and her iconic Hot Gun, Dranoel Trans now seeks her vengeance. She'll gladly use the SOCIETY to achieve it.
Dranoel Trans is a trans woman, but claims to not be “woke”. The name is entirely a coincidence, as her sisters with the same last name aren't transgender. 
When she was young, the organisation known as the “Politics” killed every last member of the “Gamers”, including her sister Kasumi. Dranoel swore to take revenge by any means necessary, and rebuilt the Gamers to rule over Peakland. She lives in the Fire Capitol, and rules Peakland with her Creeper army police force. Her iconic Hot Gun is a formidable weapon capable of shooting fire. Captain Hot hates anything political. She is using society to achieve her goals, which puts her in conflict with the Society Livers. She also hates the poor.
Other Characters
Pinsir
Evil Morty
Evil Morty is an evil version of Mortimer from Pokémon (he is Morty but when he turns evil). With the power of the berserker 2 power up, Morty takes over Pasio is the new Villain event. Morty while evil has lost his sense of good. He no longer uses Pokemon. Instead he fights himself, using his evil powes. He also battles alone. I chose his background to be a truly evil place. He is the very incarnation of evil. He is known for having blonde hair and kidnapping women into his castle. That's very Evil. As you would expect from Evil Morty of course!. Evil Morty will eventually (spoiler) be defeated at the Morty Festival. Mortimer continues to have an inside struggle for power with his berserk 1 form. Morty struggles greatly to contain his good side (Sygna Suit Morty) from coming back. Will the power of being the most popular character in Pokemon save him from evil death? Is there any hope for our young brilliant antagonist? Will Mortimer become (spoiler) the protagonist?

The Story
The Prologue 
Guts gets fished up by Heracross in a block of ice, missing an arm. Heracross breaks the ice with Close Combat. Guts recalls his bout with the Tower of Rebirth Jailer. Heracross offers Guts shelter in the shack he lives in with his gay lover Pinsir. Soon, Heracross also fishes out a frozen Puck. Right as he gets unthawed, Puck dies of cardiac arrest. The group holds a quick funeral for Puck, Guts has a really nice suit that never shows up again. 
The School Shooting Arc
Now conscious in Peakland, Guts’ first problem is his missing arm. The group decide to break into an Arms Factory to steal a mechanical arm for Guts. (needs expansion) Now equipped with a new mechanical arm, Guts sets off on his own. Before he can do that however, the creeper police show up at Heracross’ shack and blow up in their face as punishment for their crimes. Heracross and Pinsir are now in a dire need of money. A mysterious hooded figure shows up and offers them a job to shoot up a politics school. Guts is reluctant, but Heracross and Pinsir love the idea. When they get to the school, they come across an ongoing sports festival, commentated by the Pokemon Unite announcer. They decide to join (?) and Guts loses to Crustle in multiple activities like running and basketball, because of Crustle’s scoring prowess and Shell Smash. This makes Guts very upset, and he is not no longer hesitant to commit the shooting. Guts wears a hood, and Heracross and Pinsir disguise themselves as their shiny forms. When the shooting starts, Guts takes off his hood. They clear the schoolyard but hear gunshot from inside the building, and find that Team Rocket is also shooting up the school. Guts is really upset they’re killing children. They promptly defeat them and Team Rocket is blasting off again. They shoot up the rest of the school, but Crustle survives because he has sturdy. A creeper shows up and hands them the money, leading Guts to question why the buyer has connections to the police. Now that they have money and a house destroyed, they try to escape the island. Guts seeks revenge against the Tower of Rebirth Jailer, and Heracross and Pinsir decide to join him for now.
